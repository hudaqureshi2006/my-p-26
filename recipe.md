Instructions
1. Warm your Waffle iron. If you can choose settings I recommend doing darker for a crispier waffle.
In a large bowl whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar then set aside.

2. Melt the butter in a small bowl, or measure out the vegetable oil. In a medium bowl whisk the milk,
eggs and vanilla together. Stir in the melted butter or oil.

3. Add the wet mixture to the dry and mix until combined.

4. Add about 1/3 cup of batter for each waffle. This will depend on the size of your waffle maker 
so feel free to experiment with amounts. Place on a wire rack until ready to serve so they stay crisp.
